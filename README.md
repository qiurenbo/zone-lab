# Zone Lab

Zone Lab is a playground to help you understand the operation mechanism of Zone.js. Just fork/clone it and debug it with VSCode, you will find more interesting things.

## 1.Naive

Naive comes from this [I reverse-engineered Zones (zone.js) and here is what I’ve found](https://blog.angularindepth.com/i-reverse-engineered-zones-zone-js-and-here-is-what-ive-found-1f48dc87659b). You can learn how Zone.js manage multiple zones.

## 2.Counting

Counting comes from the example of [Zone.js repository](https://github.com/JiaLiPassion/zone.js). You can learn how Zone.js monkey-pach the global setTimeout and how Zone.js schedule it.

## 3.Tour

Tour is inspired by Counting but it remove some complicate code and help readers focus on the implementation inside in Zone.js.
